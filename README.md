# Cascadium

Cascadium is an lightweight pre-processor for the CSS styling language.

This small module can compile CSS with the following features into a legacy CSS file that is more compatible with most browsers.

It is written in C#, built to run in any operating system without .NET installed. Also, it's source code is open-source.

Some of what it can do:

- nesting
- single line comments
- minify and compress
- merge equivalent queries and selectors
- converters
- rewriters
